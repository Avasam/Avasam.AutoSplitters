# RiME AutoSplitter

LiveSplit AutoSplitter for RiME on PC  

## Limitations

- You will still have to stop the timer yourself.
- No Load remover.

## Recommended splits

### Any% and No Major Skips

[Tech](https://www.speedrun.com/user/Tech) created a split template with short, generic names. The number of splits is what's important, you can rename the splits and the category to your liking. See the RiME [Resources](https://www.speedrun.com/rime/resources) page on SRC.

### Any% (without Tilt Clip)

Using the Any% template, replace `-Tilt Clip 1` by `-Underwater Caves`. Also replace `-Tilt Clip 2 (Reload)` by something like this

```txt
-Queen's Hall
-Tree
-Sentinel Head
-Sentinel Body
-Escort 1 (screwdriver)
-Escort 2 (elevator)
-Elevator
-Escort 3 (queen's)
-Escort 4 (shades)
```

### 100%

No template yet, but the autosplitter should also work. If you make your own splits, please share!

## Shared Gold Splits

These are the splits that are identical between categories, meaning that you can sync your golds in both.
