# RiME AutoSplitter

LiveSplit AutoSplitter for RiME on PC  

## Limitations

- Automatic start works by timing the end of a lod to the first possible input. It assumes that you'll move as soon as possible and that you won't pause until then. Note that you can pause during the intro cutscene of Denial, before the title appears. In case you need to fix a setting last second.
- You will still have to stop the timer yourself.

## Recommended splits

[Tech](https://www.speedrun.com/user/Tech) and I created splits templates with short names. The number of splits is what's important, you can rename the splits and the category to your liking. See the [Splits Templates](https://github.com/Avasam/Avasam.Autosplitters/tree/main/RiME/Splits%20Templates) folder.
