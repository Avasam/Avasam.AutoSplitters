# RiME AutoSplitter

LiveSplit AutoSplitter for RiME on PC  

## Limitations

- Automatic start only works on Denial.
- You will still have to stop the timer yourself.

## Recommended splits

[Tech](https://www.speedrun.com/user/Tech) and I created splits templates with short names. The number of splits is what's important, you can rename the splits and the category to your liking. See the [Splits Templates](https://github.com/Avasam/Avasam.Autosplitters/tree/main/RiME/Splits%20Templates) folder.
