# Pony Island AutoSplitter

LiveSplit AutoSplitter for Pony Island

## Known issues

- Possibly unstable.  
- Autosplitter starts at first in-game frame, but rules sate we time from the click of the button on the menu. With automatic start, timer starts need to be set to at ~2.20 to respect current timing rules.  
- `Act 1` split options has to be OFF when running IL of Act 1. ON when running IL of Intro.  
- `Split at the start of the autoscroller escape sequence` may visually freeze LiveSplit for a moment, this is because a signature scan is in progress, which can be intensive.
